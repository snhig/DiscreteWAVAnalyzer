# DiscreteWAVAnalyzer

At a high level, I aim to create a python package that enables discrete signal analysis. The user would be able to import the package
into their scripts or object oriented programs to analyze discrete waveform and audio-files. The package would abstract the user from
dealing with byte unpacking, writing their own algorithms, and/or creating spectrograms/graphs.

The specific objectives of this study are to develop a python package that enables the user to perform signal analysis on discrete
waveform and audio-files. The package should provide functions to extract features from the signal, such as frequency, amplitude, and
phase. The user should be able to, optionally, generate visualizations of the signal, including spectrograms (not using pre-built
spectrogram packages) and waveforms.
